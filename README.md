# Barcode-Project-C-

JsBarcode is a barcode generator written in JavaScript. It supports multiple barcode formats and works in browsers and with Node.js. It has no dependencies when it is used for the web but works with jQuery if you are into that.

Include the script in your code:

<script src="JsBarcode.all.min.js"></script>

You are done! Go generate some barcodes ðŸ˜„
